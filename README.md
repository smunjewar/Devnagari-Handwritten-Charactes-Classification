## Dataset  
- **Source**: `DevanagariHandwrittenCharacterDataset`  
- **Train Path**: `Train/`  
- **Test Path**: `Test/`  
- **Image Dimensions**: 32x32 pixels (grayscale)

## Key Components  

### 1. **Preprocessing & Augmentation**  
- Images are loaded using **PIL** and converted into NumPy arrays.  
- Data augmentation is applied using **ImageDataGenerator**, with transformations such as:  
  - **Rotation** (10 degrees)  
  - **Width & Height Shift** (10%)  
  - **Shear Transformation**  
  - **Brightness Adjustment** (0.3 - 1.0)  
- Labels are converted into numerical values using **TensorFlowâ€™s StringLookup**.  

### 2. **Model Architecture (CNN)**  
The CNN model consists of:  
- **Input Layer**: Rescaling (normalization of pixel values)  
- **Convolutional Layers** (16, 32, 64 filters) with **ReLU activation**  
- **Max-Pooling Layers** to reduce feature map size  
- **Flatten Layer** to convert features into a 1D vector  
- **Dense Layer** (256 neurons, ReLU)  
- **Dropout Layer** (0.5) to prevent overfitting  
- **Output Layer**: 47 classes for classification  

### 3. **Model Compilation & Training**  
- **Optimizer**: Adam  
- **Loss Function**: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy  
- **Metric**: Accuracy
